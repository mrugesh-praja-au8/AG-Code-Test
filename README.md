Hello There,
I am Mrugesh Prajapati.
I have created this short project for Antarctica Global's code test(Though some work is pending.)
I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React-Redux, SASS compiler.

Project Description:
1) You will see "Login-page" at start
    * Use Login-Id: admin@gmail.com
    * Use Password: admin@123
2) After logging-in, you will reach to "Home-page"
    * Here you can see & search total number of "Roles" created
    * You can "toggle" them to "Active" state
    * You will see "All user access" table with Description of All Roles' "Access-points" those are/will be created.

## I haven't created "Add Role" Modal yet, Though you can check above mentioned features with perfect functionality, Optimised Performance and User Interface



You can run the output by using following commands in your Terminal from Project Directory:

### Go through "package.json" file & install dependencies mentioned

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This was all for running the Application on Browser and see the output.
Thank You:)
